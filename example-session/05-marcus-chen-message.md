Marcus,

You asked a direct question on the call, so here's a direct answer.

Today, monday.com's Timeline View has no dependency management. That's a real gap, and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. ClickUp making Gantt free got attention, but the honest framing is: their Gantt is single-board, finish-to-start dependencies only. For infrastructure workstreams that span multiple boards and teams, that doesn't get you very far either.

What we're building: Advanced Timeline View with dependency management. Beta starts the week of April 20. General availability in early June.

I can't give you the full feature scope on what makes it into beta today — there are still engineering decisions being finalized. What I can tell you is that dependency management is the core of what's being built, and it's being built specifically because accounts like yours have been telling us this is the gap.

On beta access: I want to have a real conversation with you about whether Meridian is a fit for early access — not just offer it generically. That means getting the right people in the same room before your renewal date. If the beta scope works for what Meridian needs, you'd have hands-on access roughly eight weeks before GA. That's worth evaluating.

Here's what I'd suggest: let's set 30 minutes before end of next week. I'll come with what I can actually commit to, not a sales deck. You bring your specific dependency use cases — particularly the cross-team infrastructure workstreams you mentioned — and we figure out together whether this is the right path for Meridian or not.

I'd rather have that conversation now than have you make a renewal decision without the full picture.

*Drafting notes: OD-1 (dep type coverage) and OD-2 (cross-board scope) are unresolved — beta scope language is deliberately hedged. OD-3 (formal beta offer) is held open as a discussion, not a commitment. Resolve OD-1/2 with Engineering before the 30-min call with Marcus.*
