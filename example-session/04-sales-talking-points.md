## One-Line Response

> "ClickUp made basic Gantt free. We're building dependency management that actually works at enterprise scale — and it's coming to beta in April."

---

## Background (internalize, don't recite)

ClickUp's free Gantt does NOT include:
- Cross-board dependencies — can't link work across multiple boards
- Portfolio Gantt — no org-wide visibility
- Bulk editing
- Only Finish-to-Start (F2S) — one of four dependency types enterprises need

Third-party reviews confirm: ClickUp is weak on reporting, portfolio, and resource management.

## Objection Handling

### "ClickUp is offering Gantt for free — why pay for monday.com?"

> "That's fair to raise. ClickUp's free Gantt covers the basics — a single board, finish-to-start dependencies only. What we're building goes deeper: dependency management across boards, bulk timeline editing, enterprise-grade visibility. Beta starts the week of April 20. If dependency tracking across your workstreams matters for how your teams actually operate, that gap matters. Want to dig into whether what we're building maps to what you need?"

---

### "We've been using ClickUp's Gantt — it's fine for our needs."

> "Good to know. What does your dependency structure look like? Are you connecting work across multiple boards or mostly within one? That's usually where the difference shows up."

*Listen. If single-board and F2S only: they may be right. If cross-board: surface the gap.*

---

### "What's monday.com's Gantt answer?"

> "We have Timeline View today. The honest answer is that dependency management is the piece we're actively building — in beta the week of April 20, GA in early June. The accounts we're talking to for early beta are those where dependency tracking is a real operational need, not just a chart preference."

## What NOT to Say

- Don't call ClickUp "basic" without immediately following with what we're building — it sounds defensive without the forward context
- Don't promise specific dependency type coverage in beta (still being scoped)
- Don't promise cross-board dependencies in beta specifically (still being scoped)
- Don't quote April 20 as a hard date on the call — use "week of April 20" or "April"

---

## Beta Access Angle

Early beta is being offered to select enterprise accounts. If a prospect is the right fit (active Timeline users, dependency-heavy workflows, multi-board teams), flag them to PM. This is a conversation opener — not a firm commitment on the call.

---

## The Retention Anchor

monday.com accounts using Timeline View churn at **4.1% annually vs. 8.4% average** — it's the stickiest surface we have. Accounts switching to ClickUp for Gantt are making a short-term feature trade against a long-term operational risk.

## Escalation

**Questions on beta scope? Escalate to PM before making any beta scope commitments.**
