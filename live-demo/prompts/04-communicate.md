# Prompt 04 — Communicate

Triggers the COMMUNICATE workflow. Reads the roadmap before writing — won't promise unconfirmed dates.

I need two things written:

**1. Sales team talking points for the VP of Sales**
She needs these by noon. Something the sales team can use in calls with prospects today when ClickUp's free Gantt comes up. Not a product essay — specific objection handling, what to say, what's coming and when.

**2. A message to Marcus at Meridian Financial**
He asked directly: "What's monday.com's answer to ClickUp's free Gantt?" He has a renewal in 8 weeks and 340 seats. I need a real response — not corporate-speak. Acknowledge the gap exists. Tell him what we're building and when. Give him a reason to stay. He's an IT director, not a marketer — he'll see through anything that isn't straight with him.

Use the timeline from the roadmap we just built. Don't promise anything that isn't in there.

**To adapt for your company:**
- Replace "VP of Sales" with your actual stakeholder
- Replace "Marcus at Meridian Financial" with your at-risk customer
- Replace "ClickUp's free Gantt" with your competitive threat
- Replace the tone context ("IT director, not a marketer") with your customer's actual role
