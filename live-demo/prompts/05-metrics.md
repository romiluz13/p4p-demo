# Prompt 05 — Metrics

Triggers the METRICS workflow. Use this after the roadmap, or when someone asks "how do you know if it worked?"

Before we ship this, I want to make sure the success metrics in the spec are actually measurable.

The metrics I have right now:
- Timeline View WAU in enterprise from 34% to 52%
- Enterprise win rate vs ClickUp from 54% to 65%
- Enterprise annual churn from 8.4% to under 7%

A few things I'm not sure about:
- These are all lagging indicators. What tells us within 2-4 weeks of launch whether this is working?
- What guardrail metrics should I set — what should NOT change after we ship?
- We're building this specifically because of Marcus, Sarah, and Rebecca. How do we track whether we actually retained those three accounts?
- Is there a leading signal from Timeline feature adoption that predicts churn reduction?

Give me the full metrics framework — leading, lagging, account-specific, and guardrails.

**To adapt for your company:**
- Replace the three lagging metrics with your actual baselines and targets
- Replace "Marcus, Sarah, and Rebecca" with your named accounts
- Keep the questions — they work for any feature launch
