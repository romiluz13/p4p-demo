We have the spec. Now I need to figure out where Advanced Timeline lands in the Q3 roadmap.

Here's what's competing for engineering capacity:

1. **Advanced Timeline View** (the spec we just wrote) — estimated 8 weeks of eng work across 2 squads

2. **Enterprise Audit Logs** — security compliance requirement. Three enterprise accounts have explicitly said they can't sign a new contract without SOC 2-aligned audit logs. Combined deal value: ~$240k new ARR. Estimated: 4 weeks.

3. **AI-generated Board Templates** — smart onboarding that generates a custom board from a prompt. High marketing value. No customer is blocking on this. Estimated: 6 weeks.

4. **WorkDocs AI summaries** — AI-powered meeting note and status update generation inside WorkDocs. High NPS value, moderate retention signal. Estimated: 5 weeks.

5. **Custom Branding for enterprise** — white-label dashboards. 8 enterprise accounts have explicitly requested it. Moderate churn risk. Estimated: 3 weeks.

Q3 total capacity: ~14 weeks of senior eng time (two squads of 3 engineers each, 7-week sprint cycle).

Where does Advanced Timeline land? RICE score each item. Show me what fits in Q3, what doesn't, and what the trade-offs are. Be honest about the assumptions driving the scores.
