# Prompt 02 — Spec

Triggers the SPEC workflow. Reads research findings automatically before writing.

Based on what we just found, I want to define our response feature.

The core gap is clear: our Timeline View doesn't support dependency management. Marcus at Meridian Financial has a renewal in 8 weeks. Sarah's team at Constellation is manually working around this. ClickUp's free Gantt has dependency arrows. We don't.

I want to spec "Advanced Timeline View" — a significant upgrade to our existing Timeline that adds:
- Dependency management (task A must complete before task B can start)
- Critical path visualization
- Bulk dependency editing
- Probably enterprise-only given the complexity

Pull in the research findings. I want the spec grounded in actual evidence — the customer pain, the competitive gap, the enterprise-specific requirements. Not assumptions.

Can you write the full PRD? P0/P1/P2 cut. Success metrics with baselines. I want it to be the thing I could actually take to engineering tomorrow.

**To adapt for your company:**
- Replace "Advanced Timeline View" with your feature name
- Replace "dependency management, critical path, bulk editing" with your specific capabilities
- Replace "Marcus at Meridian Financial" and "Sarah's team at Constellation" with your customers
- Replace "ClickUp's free Gantt" with your competitive threat
- Replace "enterprise-only" with your target tier
